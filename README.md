================

code for basic intro talk on Angularjs.  Hosted at http://angular.isourthing.com/

Notes to talk about:

### Why Javascript 'App'
 - Have lots of APIs, very few UI
 - Rapidly deploy clients as static HTML

### Why Angular

 - State in your models 
 	- no subclassing
 - Namespaces / Scopes
 - Testing matters
 - Dependency Injection
 - Rich Ecosystem

### Simplest possible example - 01-hello-world
 - You should not have to learn a framework to use a framework (insert Java / Maven joke here)
 - Review simple example, data binding
 - Review hello-controller.html
   - Look at the scopes
   - add button to see UI react to data 
 - Talk about DI again

### TDD segue
 - Make an angular front end for the calculator class of http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/

### Talk about custom filters
 - Show how to test HTTP calls

### using yeoman / app seed
 - Introduce modules
 	- Namespaces & Scopes are a great ideas - do them more
 	- Encourage reusable modules and services
 - Introduce routes
 	- Single page apps are all the rage.
 	- HTML pushstate and fallbacks, angular handles it
 	- Reverse routing, like rails
 - Introduce filters
 	- Illadelphia
 	- encoideID?
 - mention directives
 	- show angular-bootstrap accordion
